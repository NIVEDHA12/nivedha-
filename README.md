Project Title:
  Write a program that takes three integers - first two the size of two jars and third, the desired
quantity, and print out steps to get the desired quantity.

Discription:
	In this repository I have given two solution one in C and the other in 
C++.I would like to mention that the solution i C will provide the minimum number of steps that is required 
to obtain desired quantity of water using 2 known quantity of water in the jars.
 While the solution in C++ gives the step by step solution for acquiring desired 
quantity of water using BFS algorithm.

Implementation:
	When you open the solution code, and then copy the code and run it in any 
online compilers i.e., Onlinegdb.com, since I have used online compilers while
executing the same.
